# Using the Calendar Plugin

There isn't much setup to do with this plugin, you just have to make sure you have your templates setup properly. The `Calendar` plugin reads from the `Daily Notes` plugin, so make sure you have `Daily Notes` setup properly. Find the `Daily Notes` setup [[Daily Notes Plugin|here]].
