# Using The Icons Plugin

Now this one isn't necessary at all, it just gives a more aesthetically pleasing look to your notes. I tend to use this instead of emojis ðŸŒ¿. There is an `Emoji Toolbar` plugin that you can use, but if you'd like to use `Icons`, this guide will help.

The plugin supports two Icon packs
-   [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/)
-   [FontAwesome (Free)](https://fontawesome.com/)

Install the plugin and follow the steps. Depending on which icon packs you install, you can then toggle on the icon packs you'd like to see in the toolbar.

Once you have this installed, you can customize your daily notes template as you wish!
