# Using The Daily Notes Plugin

This plugin is a core plugin, meaning you'll find it under `Setting` > `Options` > `Core Plugins`. Once you have it installed, you'll need to toggle it on and setup a few things.


The first will be your daily notes folder. This will tell `Daily Notes` where you want to *house* all of your daily journal entries.

Then you'll have to setup the file location of your daily journal template. This will tell `Daily Notes` what template to use whenever you spawn a new daily entry.

Once you've done this, you'll be good to go!
